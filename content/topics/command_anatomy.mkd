Anatomy of a Command
====================

We've been talking of running commands and passing arguments and whatnot, but
we haven't really explained what exactly we're doing. To get a better hold on
how commands can be used, let's run through some examples.

Commands
--------

To begin with, a command is just a program somewhere on the filesystem. For
instance, you're probably familiar with firefox - on Linux, it should be
installed in '/usr/bin/firefox'. In fact, your desktop icon for firefox probably
references this address itself.

Modifying Commands
------------------

Programs can be written to be very flexible and versatile, so that you can
tweak the behavior of a command very easily by changing how you call the
command. You can pass commands what are known as *arguments* to make commands
change their behavior.

For instance, if you wanted to view the contents of
'/cat/doc/meetings/agenda.dog', you could do `less /cat/doc/meetings/agenda.dog`
to view the agenda. The '/cat/doc/meetings/agenda.dog' would be an *argument*
for the 'less' command. In short, arguments are effectively anything that
follows a command. In this case, /cat/doc/meetings/agenda.dog is the file that
less would display, so it controls what less does.

There are also a subset of arguments called *options* or *flags*. While an
argument to less like /cat/doc/meetings/agenda.dog controls what 'less' does, an
option would change how 'less' does things. For instance, if you did `less -K
/cat/doc/meetings/agenda.dog`, you could hit ctrl+c to exit less instead of
having to hit 'q'.

For another example, files that are prefixed with a period, like '.profile' are
not displayed by `ls` by default. However, we can change this behavior by using
an option, '-a' or '--all' and run `ls --all` to display all files, hidden or
otherwise. This also demonstrates that options may have a short form, like '-a',
or a long form, like '--all'. They do the same thing, but one is faster to type
while the other is more clear to read.

An Example
----------

Let's play around with one of my pet programs, Facter. Facter is a command line
program that you can use to easily display system information, or other facts.
You can see the output by running `facter`.

If you did that, you would probably get something like this:

    domain => local
    facterversion => 1.6.0
    fqdn => dre.local
    hardwaremodel => i386
    hostname => dre
    id => adrien
    is_virtual => false
    kernel => Darwin
    kernelmajversion => 10.8
    kernelrelease => 10.8.0
    kernelversion => 10.8.0
    macosx_productname => Mac OS X
    macosx_productversion => 10.6.8
    operatingsystem => Darwin
    operatingsystemrelease => 10.8.0
    puppetversion => 2.7.3
    rubyversion => 1.8.7
    swapencrypted => true
    swapfree => 64.00M
    swapsize => 64.00M
    timezone => PST
    uptime => 3:10 hours
    uptime_days => 0
    uptime_hours => 3
    uptime_seconds => 11425
    virtual => physical

So this is an example of calling a command, with no arguments, no commands, just
running `facter` and we get some useful output.

Reading the man page
--------------------

If we were to open up the man page by doing `man facter`, we would see something
like this as the usage:

    USAGE:
        facter  [-d|--debug]  [-h|--help]  [-p|--puppet]  [-v|--version] [-y|--yaml] [fact] [fact] [...]

Now of course there's a lot of information packed in here, but there's no
obvious significance to anything. Let's walk through it.

Breaking Up Command Usage
-------------------------

    facter  [-d|--debug]  [-h|--help]  [-p|--puppet]  [-v|--version] [-y|--yaml] [fact] [fact] [...]
      ^     |                                                                                      |
      |     +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
      |                          These are the possible arguments and options
      â”” This is the command

Options
-------

The following are options that Facter understands:

  * **-d** or **--debug**: turns on debugging information for Facter
  * **-h** or **--help**: displays Facter's help information
  * **-p** or **--puppet**: loads extra facts using a different program, puppet
  * **-v** or **--version**: shows the version of Facter that we're using
  * **-y** or **--yaml**: changes the output of Facter to use 'yaml', or 'Yet
    Another Markup Language'

In each case, the first and second options are synonyms, so we can either put
emphasis on brevity and use the short form, such as when we're typing a command,
or clarity and use the long form, when we're telling someone else how to use
Facter.

In the man page, each one of these is surrounded by square brackets. This means
that the options are, well, optional. That is, you can call Facter with or
without them.

Arguments
---------

At the end of the usage, you'll see reference to '[fact]'. This means that you
can call Facter with additional arguments, specifically one or more facts.
Instead of displaying all facts like we did earlier, you can only display a set
number of facts.

Examples
--------

- - -

    % facter hostname id uptime
    hostname => dre
    id => adrien
    uptime => 4:21 hours

This is an example of me calling Facter with three arguments, 'hostname', 'id', and
'uptime'. Facter will then only try to retrieve this information for me.

- - -

    % facter --debug hostname id uptime
    Caught recursion on kernel
    value for kernel is still nil
    hostname => dre
    id => adrien
    uptime => 4:22 hours

This is me calling Facter with the same arguments, but with the '--debug' option.
This can be used to diagnose issues with Facter.

- - -

    facter --yaml hostname id uptime
    ---
    id: adrien
    uptime: 4:24 hours
    hostname: dre

Instead of asking for debug information, this time I'm calling Facter with the
'--yaml' option, which means that I want the output to be formatted in a certain
way. As you see, the format's been changed somewhat markedly.

- - -

    % facter --version id hostname uptime
    1.6.0

Sometimes options can entirely change how a command is called. In this case I'm
calling Facter with the '--version' option but still trying to retrieve facts.
However, Facter can either retrieve facts or display the version, so when it
gets the '--version' flag it immediately displays the version, and then exits.

How Commands Receive Arguments
------------------------------

You'll notice that the distinction between options and regular arguments are a
bit blurry. The reason for this is that there is no true distinction between
the two. Options are a convention adopted to make commands a bit more usable,
among other reasons.

The way programs actually see these is as a list of values. When Facter is
called like `facter --yaml id hostname uptime`, for instance, it gets the
following in a list:

 * --yaml
 * id
 * hostname
 * uptime

It's entirely up to Facter to decide what to do with these values. In this case,
Facter will start up, look at these options and see that it has one option and
three arguments. It'll look at the option and see that it's supposed to return
information as yaml, so it'll note that for when it outputs the information.
It'll next see that it has three arguments, and so it'll take the steps needed
to find the information to determine these facts. Finally, it'll go to output
these facts, see that it already noted to output the facts as yaml, and then
print the following:

    ---
    id: adrien
    uptime: 4:24 hours
    hostname: dre

The reason we distinguish the '--yaml' option from just another agument is so
that we could also have a fact called 'yaml' and be able to retrieve that fact,
while not confusing it with the desired output mode.
